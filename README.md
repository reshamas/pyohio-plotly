### Talk Description
[Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) is a versatile python graphing library which lets us make interactive graphs.  In this talk, I will show how to go from a typical static visualization to one enriched with annotations which will convey to your audience a more complete interpretation of your visualization. 

Here are some sample [plotly visualizations](https://reshamas.github.io/covid19-plots/) I have made, and in this talk, I will share how to create them.

### Talk objective
